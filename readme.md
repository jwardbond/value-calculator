This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## value-calculator

This calculator uses simple pairwise comparisons to help you rank a set of properties according to how much you personally value them.

For instance: when buying a car you may be looking for cars that have <80 000 km, are between 9 000 and 11 000 dollars, and that has enough room for your family of four. In order to make a purely emotionless decisions, say between an 11 000 dollar car with 75 000 km on it and a 10 000 car with 65 000 km on it, you need to know how much you value the mileage compared to the price of the car. This can get complicated to sort out when you consider more than a couple properties.

So, this calculator dumbs it down. Every property is compared to every other property one at a time, and then in the end the properties are ranked based on how much you personally value each of them.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

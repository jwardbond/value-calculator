** value-calculator

This calculator uses simple pairwise comparisons to help you rank a set of properties according to how much you personally value them.

For instance: when buying a car you may be looking for cars that have <80 000 km, are between 9 000 and 11 000 dollars, and that has enough room for your family of four. In order to make a purely emotionless decisions, say between an 11 000 dollar car with 75 000 km on it and a 10 000 car with 65 000 km on it, you need to know how much you value the mileage compared to the price of the car. This can get complicated to sort out when you consider more than a couple properties.

So, this calculator dumbs it down. Every property is compared to every other property one at a time, and then in the end the properties are ranked based on how much you personally value each of them.
